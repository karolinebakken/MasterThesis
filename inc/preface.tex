\chapter*{Preface}
This project is meant as an answer to the subject TMR4930 Marine Technology, Master Thesis, and thus serves as a master thesis in Marine Structural Engineering at the Department of Marine Technology at NTNU. The work was carried out in the spring of 2019. \newline
\newline
The topic for the thesis is fatigue of dynamic power cables applied in offshore wind farms. This topic was chosen due to the author's interest in fatigue, a well as the opportunity to use well-known methods and software from the oil and gas industry with new and upcoming renewable technology. The goal of the project is to estimate the lifetime of a dynamic power cable attached to a floating offshore wind turbine at a chosen location, as well as get an insight in the friction mechanisms in the cross section and their impact on fatigue life of the power cable. \\\\ The report contains a comprehensive literature study and theory about offshore wind, dynamic power cables, and fatigue. It also includes a description of the modeling of two different numeric models as well as global and local analyses and post-processing of the results. The numeric background for the software used is also included. In the course of the work, choices and simplifications were made in line with the recommendations of the supervisor Professor Svein SÃ¦vik. \newline
\newline
This master thesis is a continuation of a project thesis executed in the fall of 2018. All the work has been executed by the author, Karoline Bakken.
