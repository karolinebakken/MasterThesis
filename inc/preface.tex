\chapter*{Preface}
This project is meant as an answer to the subject TMR4930 Marine Technology, Master Thesis, and thus serves as a master thesis in Marine Structural Engineering at the Department of Marine Technology at NTNU. The work and was carried out in the spring of 2019. \newline
\newline
The topic for the Master Thesis is fatigue of dynamic power cable applied in offshore wind farms. This topic was chosen due to the author's interest for fatigue, a well as the opportunity to use well-known methods and software from the oil and gas industry with new and upcoming renewable technology. The goal of the project is to estimate the lifetime of a cable attached to a floating offshore wind turbine at a chosen location, as well as look at the effect of fatigue life if friction between wires in the conductor is included. This Master Thesis contains a comprehensive literature study and theory about offshore wind, dynamic power cables, and fatigue. It also includes a description of the modeling of two different numeric models as well as global and local analyses and post processing of the results and estimation of fatigue life and comparison of fatigue life with and without friction in conductors. The numeric background for the software that will be used in the master thesis is also included. \newline
\newline
This Master Thesis is a continuation of a Project Thesis executed in the fall of 2018. All the work have been executed by the author, Karoline Bakken.
